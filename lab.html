<p>We can use code-fold to collapse the code into an HTML <detail> tag. We can include “code-fold:true” underneath the “toc: true” block. This way, all the code won’t automatically display, but can be accessed by the user by clicking the tag.</detail></p>
<p>Briefly describe how we produce a pdf.</p>
<p>To produce a pdf, we can change the format in the YAML header to pdf. However, to create the pdf, we need to install a recent distribution of TeX, and then the changing of the format will work.</p>

<p>Explain their differences.</p>
<p>The “df$x” operation for data frames access the “xyz” column through partial name matching. This does not occur for the tibble because it doesn’t do partial name matching.</p>
<p>The df[[2]] and tib[[2]] operations produce the same output because they index in the same way.</p>
<p>df[“xyz”] produces a data frame, while tib[“xyz”] produces another tibble.</p>
<p>df[c(“abc”, “xyz”)] produces a data frame with both columns, while tib[c(“abc”, “xyz”)] produces a tibble showing both columns and their types.</p>
<p>df[, 2] subsets df and produces a data frame. tib[, 2] produces a tibble.</p>
<p>df[, “xyz”] produces a data frame, tib[, “xyz”] produces a tibble</p>
<p>df[, c(“abc”, “xyz”)] produces a data frame. tib[, c(“abc”, “xyz”)] produces a tibble.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Using more predictors increases the accuracy because it represents more of the dataset instead of a small subset. It is limited in how much more accurate it is, for example K=3 vs K=10 only differed by about 3.5% in accuracy, but it still showcases a more accurate model. <!-- Once done, commit with message "22-knn" and push your work to GitHub. --></p>

<p><strong>This biplot showcases the PC1 vs PC2 for each datapoint in the iris dataset. It showcases the trend for which category ecah variable falls under, either PC1, making it a core component, or PC2 making it not a core component in determining the species. Petal length and Petal weidth are both shown as having a positive PC1 and near 0 PC2, meaning they both contribute greatly to determining what the species is. Sepal width and Sepal length have increased PC2, showcasing that they are not as important in determining the species.</strong></p>
